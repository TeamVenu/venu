# VENU
Wayfinding app for Imagine RIT

## About
**VENU** is a wayfinding app made specifically for **Imagine RIT**. Users can utilize the app to see nearby exhibits and facilities. They can add events to their itinerary as well as navigate to the buildings where these exhibits are located. **VENU** was created as our capstone project for the **New Media** at the **Rochester Institute of Technology** which incorporates both designers and developers.
