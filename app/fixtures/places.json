        "description": "Did you realize that when you solve a maze or other puzzle, you are thinking like a computer? Any series of steps taken to solve a problem is an algorithm, whether it is a human algorithm or a computer algorithm! In our exhibit, you will have the chance to solve some life-size mazes by walking around, and we will have other puzzles to solve as well. We will also discuss our related research in which we use puzzles as a way to teach computational thinking at RIT.",

The app may now prompt users during runtime for permissions as they are needed. This allows users to confirm or deny specific permission requests, but still be able to use the app. However, these profound changes lead to some challenging questions, one of which is if users feel more comfortable with this new permission model, or if it will lead to further confusion and concerns over the app's requested permissions?",

The machine is programmable using an easy to use graphical interface that allows for rapid changes to part geometry on the fly. This project highlights the growing trend that automated manufacturing can now be implemented on a very low budget yet still produce high quality components.",
