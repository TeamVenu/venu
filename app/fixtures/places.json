In Android's new permission model (Android 'M'), users are no longer expected to confirm or deny all requested permissions upon installation of the application. The app may now prompt users during runtime for permissions as they are needed. This allows users to confirm or deny specific permission requests, but still be able to use the app. However, these profound changes lead to some challenging questions, one of which is if users feel more comfortable with this new permission model, or if it will lead to further confusion and concerns over the app's requested permissions?",

				"description": "Our goal is to improve RIT's Infinity Statue. The artist's intent was to represent the idea of infinity; both through the 3 sided mobius mounted and top and through it's continuous rotation. The drive train responsible for this rotation has required reoccurring maintenance, resulting in the statue remaining stagnant for long periods of time. The intent of this design project is to re-design or modify the statue's drive train to assure that the statue's artistic intent is realized.",
