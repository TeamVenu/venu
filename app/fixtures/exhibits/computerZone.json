Accessibility is about enabling people of all abilities to have equal access to information needed for work and life. In this exhibit, attendees will interact with a mobile app that simulates the experience of users with visual impairment. This helps attendees develop a real empathy for users and a deeper understanding of how physical, cognitive and situational disabilities affect daily life activities.",

      "description": "Android apps operate under a permission-based system where an app requires specific permissions to carry out specific functionality. In Android's new permission model (Android 'M'), users are no longer expected to confirm or deny all requested permissions upon installation of the application. The app may now prompt users during runtime for permissions as they are needed. This allows users to confirm or deny specific permission requests, but still be able to use the app. However, these profound changes lead to some challenging questions, one of which is if users feel more comfortable with this new permission model, or if it will lead to further confusion and concerns over the app's requested permissions?",
