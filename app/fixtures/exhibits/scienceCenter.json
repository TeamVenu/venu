Along with the assembly, we will also be displaying two virtual simulations; a thermal simulation and a stress analysis of our CubeSat design and a thermal simulation and stress analysis of an existing \"for purchase\" CubeSat that we would be using for a comparison. Also, we are planning to show an orbital simulator that we will design and manufacture ourselves.",

These tests included different area ratios, nozzle geometries, and nozzle determination methods. The series of nozzles will be on display with one mounted upon the system. There will be various videos and pictures displaying our experience designing, fabricating, and testing this system.",

Come contribute your weight to a color mixture in our lights and see how this all works in our interactive physical demo!",
