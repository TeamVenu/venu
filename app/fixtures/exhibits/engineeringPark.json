      "description": "A non-Newtonian fluid is one in which the rate of strain is not linearly proportional to the rate of shear stress. A shear thickening, or dilatant, fluid becomes more viscous, or resistant to flow, as more shear stress is applied. This happens when long, branchy molecules, like starch, get tangled as they move quickly past each other and act like a solid. However, when moving slow, the molecules are able to pass by each other, and act like a liquid.",

This printer has ability to move in the vertical direction, allowing for multiple layers of the ink to be jetted and cured on top of each other. Visitors may view the system and ask questions related to its operation and applications.",
