In Android's new permission model (Android 'M'), users are no longer expected to confirm or deny all requested permissions upon installation of the application. The app may now prompt users during runtime for permissions as they are needed. This allows users to confirm or deny specific permission requests, but still be able to use the app. However, these profound changes lead to some challenging questions, one of which is if users feel more comfortable with this new permission model, or if it will lead to further confusion and concerns over the app's requested permissions?",

However, when moving slow, the molecules are able to pass by each other, and act like a liquid.",

Many of these require specialized equipment requiring storage space, provided by SportsNet, while not in use. Initially their storage facility was not efficiently organized and contained safety hazards. The goal of this project was to improve the space utilization within the unit to make storing and locating equipment more efficient and safer.",
