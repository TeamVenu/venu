Visitors will learn about the prevalence of asthma, how it can be treated, and our innovative design. This exhibit will allow visitors a hands on experience with demos of the 1Haler and other inhalers currently used by asthma patients. The 1Haler is cheaper, easier to use, and more convenient to use than its competitors on the market; this exhibit showcases its novelty.",
