      "description": "Stop by the Scholar's Bench between 10:00am and 1:00pm to participate one (or both!) of these exciting contests brought to you by the School of Communication! Communicate This! challenges you to deliver a 15-20 second speech and post it to Facebook. By the end of the day, the speech with the most 'likes' wins the prize. Wordistry is a a language-creation contest contest inviting you play with words and definitions. Words are added to our language on a regular basis. Telling someone you are taking a 'selfie' would have raised eyebrow a few short years ago. What new word can you add to the American lexicon? The best submissions as judged by a panel of students and faculty from RIT's School of Communication will win a valuable prize!",

      "description": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) pollution from satellites is of increasing concern. What has caused the pollution levels of the present LEO environment? We show that the problem mirrors a tragedy of the commons scenario. A key factor is that satellite launchers inefficiently discount the exponential creation of debris as satellites collide over time. We explore how this inefficiency can be corrected.",
